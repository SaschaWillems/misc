## Examples

### Basics

#### [01 - Triangle](examples/triangle/)
**New Description**<br>
Basic and verbose example for getting a colored triangle rendered to the screen using Vulkan. This is meant as a starting point for learning Vulkan from the ground up. A huge part of the code is boilerplate that is abstracted away in later examples.

#### [02 - Pipelines](examples/pipelines/)
**New Description**<br>
Using pipeline state objects (pso) that bake state information (rasterization states, culling modes, etc.) along with the shaders into a single object, making it easy for an implementation to optimize usage (compared to OpenGL's dynamic state machine). Also demonstrates the use of pipeline derivatives.

#### [03 - Dynamic uniform buffers](examples/dynamicuniformbuffer/)
**New Description**<br>
Dynamic uniform buffers are used for rendering multiple objects with multiple matrices stored in a single uniform buffer object. Individual matrices are dynamically addressed upon descriptor binding time, minimizing the number of required descriptor sets.

#### [04 - Push constants](examples/pushconstants/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses push constants, small blocks of uniform data stored within a command buffer, to pass data to a shader without the need for uniform buffers.

#### [05 - Specialization constants](examples/specializationconstants/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses SPIR-V specialization constants to create multiple pipelines with different lighting paths from a single "uber" shader.

#### [06 - Texture mapping](examples/texture/)
**New Description**<br>
Loads a 2D texture from disk (including all mip levels), uses staging to upload it into video memory and samples from it using combined image samplers.

#### [07 - Cube map textures](examples/texturecubemap/)
**New Description**<br>
Loads a cube map texture from disk containing six different faces. All faces and mip levels are uploaded into video memory and the cubemap is sampled once as a skybox (for the background) and as a source for reflections (for a 3D model).

#### [08 - Texture arrays](examples/texturearray/)
**New Description**<br>
Loads a 2D texture array containing multiple 2D texture slices (each with it's own mip chain) and renders multiple meshes each sampling from a different layer of the texture. 2D texture arrays don't do any interpolation between the slices.

#### [09 - 3D textures](examples/texture3d/)
**New Description**<br>
Generates a 3D texture on the cpu (using perlin noise), uploads it to the device and samples it to render an animation. 3D textures store volumetric data and interpolate in all three dimensions.

#### [10 - Model rendering](examples/mesh/)
**New Description**<br>
Loads a 3D model and texture maps from a common file format (using [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)), uploads the vertex and index buffer data to video memory, sets up a matching vertex layout and renders the 3D model.

#### [11 - Sub passes](examples/subpasses/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses sub passes to read from previous framebuffer at the same pixel position within a single render pass. This is used for the deferred render composition with added forward transparency within a single renderpass.

#### [12 - Offscreen rendering](examples/offscreen/)
**New Description**<br>
Basic offscreen rendering in two passes. First pass renders the mirrored scene to a separate framebuffer with color and depth attachments, second pass samples from that color attachment for rendering a mirror surface.face.

#### [13 - CPU particle system](examples/particlefire/)
**New Description**<br>
Implements a simple cpu based particle system. Particle data is stored in host memory, updated on the CPU per-frame and synchronized with the device before it's rendered using pre-multiplied alpha.

**New Description**<br>
Uses the stencil buffer and it's compare functionality for rendering a 3D model with dynamic outlines.

### Advanced

#### [01 - Scene rendering](examples/scenerendering/)
**New Description**<br>
Combines multiple techniques to render a complex scene consisting of multiple meshes, textures and materials. Meshes are stored and rendered from a single buffer using vertex offsets.

#### [02 - Multi sampling](examples/multisampling/)
**New Description**<br>
Implements multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) using a renderpass with multisampled attachments and resolve attachments that get resolved into the visible frame buffer.

#### [03 - High dynamic range](examples/hdr/)
**New Description**<br>
Implements a high dynamic range rendering pipeline using 16/32 bit floating point precision for all internal formats, textures and calculations, including a bloom pass, manual exposure and tone mapping. 

#### [04 - Shadow mapping](examples/shadowmapping/)
**New Description**<br>
Rendering shadows for a directional light source. First pass stores depth values from the light's pov, second pass compares against these to check if a fragment is shadowed. Uses depth bias to avoid shadow artifacts and applies a PCF filer to smooth shadows.

#### [05 - Cascaded shadow mapping](examples/shadowmappingcascade/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses multiple shadow maps (stored as a layered texture) to increase shadow resolution for larger scenes. The camera frustum is split up into multiple cascades with corresponding layers in the shadow map. Layer selection for shadowing depth compare is then done by comparing fragment depth with the cascades' depths ranges.

#### [06 - Omnidirectional shadow mapping](examples/shadowmappingomni/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses a dynamic floating point cube map to implement shadowing for a point light source that casts shadows in all directions. The cube map is updated every frame and stores distance to the light source for each fragment used to determine if a fragment is shadowed.

#### [07 - Run-time mip-map generation](examples/texturemipmapgen/)
**New Description**<br>
Generating a complete mip-chain at runtime instead of loading it from a file, by blitting from one mip level, starting with the actual texture image, down to the next smaller size until the lower 1x1 pixel end of the mip chain.

#### [08 - Skeletal animation](examples/skeletalanimation/)
**New Description**<br>

### Performance

#### [01 - Multi threaded command buffer generation](examples/multithreading/)
**New Description**<br>

Instead of prebuilding and reusing the same command buffers this sample uses multiple hardware threads to demonstrate parallel per-frame recreation of secondary command buffers that are executed and submitted in a primary buffer once all threads have finished.

#### [02 - Instancing](examples/instancing/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses the instancing feature for rendering many instances of the same mesh from a single vertex buffer with variable parameters and textures (indexing a layered texture). Instanced data is passed using a secondary vertex buffer.

#### [03 - Indirect drawing](examples/indirectdraw/)
**New Description**<br>
Rendering thousands of instanced objects with different geometry using one single indirect draw call instead of issuing separate draws.

#### [03 - Textured PBR with IBL](examples/pbrtexture/)
**New Description**<br>

These examples use a [deferred shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading) setup.

#### [01 - Deferred shading basics](examples/deferred/)
**New Description**<br>
Uses multiple render targets to fill all attachments (albedo, normals, position, depth) required for a G-Buffer in a single pass. A deferred pass then uses these to calculate shading and lighting in screen space, so that calculations only have to be done for visible fragments independent of no. of lights.
